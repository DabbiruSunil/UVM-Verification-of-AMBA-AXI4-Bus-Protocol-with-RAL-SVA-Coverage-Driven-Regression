# UVM Verification of AMBA AXI4 Bus Protocol with RAL, SVA & Coverage-Driven Regression

A parameterized **SystemVerilog UVM 1.2** verification environment for the **AMBA AXI4 bus protocol**, featuring a virtual sequencer, master/slave agents, reference memory model scoreboard, RAL-based CSR abstraction, SVA protocol assertions, and functional coverage closure which is runnable directly on **EDA Playground (Aldec Riviera-PRO)**.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project implements a complete UVM testbench to verify an AXI4 slave memory DUT. The environment exercises all five AXI4 channels (AW, W, B, AR, R) with constrained-random and targeted sequences, checks protocol compliance via SVA assertions, and tracks functional coverage across burst types, QoS levels, exclusive access, and error responses.

The DUT is a 256-location AXI4-compliant slave memory written in synthesizable SystemVerilog, making this environment suitable for both simulation and as a reference for real SoC peripheral verification.

## ✨ Features

- **Parameterized Environment** : configurable data width (32/64/128-bit) and address width (32/64-bit) via interface parameters
- **Virtual Sequencer** : coordinates master agent sequences for end-to-end multi-scenario regression
- **Reference Memory Model** : scoreboard reconstructs expected read data from all prior writes and compares against DUT responses, catching data-integrity bugs beyond signal-level checking
- **RAL Model (Register Abstraction Layer)** : models peripheral CSR fields (`enable`, `mode`) using `uvm_reg` and `uvm_reg_block`, mirroring real SoC verification methodology
- **SVA Protocol Assertions** : three concurrent properties enforce AXI4 handshake rules:
  - `AWVALID` must not deassert before `AWREADY`
  - `ARVALID` must not deassert before `ARREADY`
  - `WVALID` must not deassert before `WREADY`
- **Functional Coverage** : covergroup with cross-coverage targeting:
  - Burst types: FIXED, INCR, WRAP
  - Burst lengths: single, short, medium, long
  - Response codes: OKAY, SLVERR, DECERR
  - QoS levels: low, mid, high
  - Lock modes: normal, exclusive
- **Three Sequence Types**:
  - `axi4_rand_seq` : constrained-random write/read transactions (30 by default)
  - `axi4_exclusive_seq` : exclusive read followed by exclusive write (`ARLOCK/AWLOCK`)
  - `axi4_error_seq` : out-of-range address injection to provoke error responses

## 🧪 Test Scenarios

| Test Sequence | What it verifies |
|---|---|
| `axi4_rand_seq` (30 txns) | Constrained-random burst writes and reads across all burst types and lengths |
| `axi4_exclusive_seq` | Exclusive read + exclusive write handshake (`ARLOCK/AWLOCK = 01`) |
| `axi4_error_seq` | Out-of-range address (`0xDEAD0000`) to trigger error response handling |

---

## 📊 Coverage Targets

| Coverpoint | Bins |
|---|---|
| Burst type | FIXED, INCR, WRAP |
| Burst length | single (0), short (1–3), medium (4–7), long (8–15) |
| Response | OKAY, SLVERR, DECERR |
| QoS | low (0–3), mid (4–11), high (12–15) |
| Lock | normal, exclusive |
| Cross | burst_type × burst_length (12 cross bins) |

## 🔒 SVA Protocol Assertions

Three concurrent SystemVerilog Assertions run throughout simulation inside the interface:

```systemverilog
// AWVALID must remain stable until AWREADY
property aw_stable;
  @(posedge clk) disable iff (!rst_n)
  awvalid && !awready |=> awvalid;
endproperty
assert property (aw_stable) else $error("AWVALID deasserted before AWREADY");
```

Similar properties cover `ARVALID` and `WVALID`.
